## Summary
One Drawback to this page is in order to properly filter the data the user must be familiar it, there isn't much room to play around and explore

A suggestion to fix this issue is allow for either partial matches to be included in searches as to minizme the issue where the serach has to be an exact match. Or another option is to allow for a date range to be filtered as opposed to just one date.
